# Cornucopia
The horn of plenty.


To whom this may concern,
I wanted to have a place where I could access all my files and code in one place, 
without the need to get my laptop out. I was making a Github account anyway so I 
said hey, why not make use of it? All these projects are for the CUS 1115 class
that I had with Prof. Anne Smith-Thompson, so if you find yourself in need of help
take these as a sort of inpiration and guide, make sure not to plagurize (because
the entire field of computer science totally isnt just copy and pasting Stack 
overflow code into your code. 

Hope this is helpful,
